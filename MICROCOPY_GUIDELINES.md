# Microcopy & CTA Guidelines

This document outlines the microcopy and call-to-action (CTA) improvements for the Nawaa platform.

- ❌ "Learn More"

- ✅ "Find Trainers Near You"
- ❌ "View Trainers"

- ✅ "Browse 50+ Learning Spaces"
- ❌ "See Spaces"

### 2. Specific Error Messages
Help users fix problems with clear, actionable feedback:
- ✅ "Please enter a valid email address (example: you@example.com)"
- ❌ "Invalid email"

- ✅ "Email address is required"
- ❌ "Error"

- ✅ "Password must be at least 8 characters"
- ❌ "Invalid password"

### 3. Scannable Headings
Make headings clear, benefit-focused, and easy to scan:
- ✅ "Everything You Need to Build Real Projects"
- ❌ "Our Features"

- ✅ "Find Your Perfect Learning Path in 5 Minutes"
- ❌ "Smart Assessment"

- ✅ "Join 10,000+ Innovators - Get Weekly STEM Updates"
- ❌ "Newsletter"

### Error Message Best Practices

1. **Be specific about what's wrong**

2. **Provide guidance on how to fix it**
   - ✅ "Please enter a valid email address (example: you@example.com)"
   - ❌ "Invalid format"

3. **Use friendly, helpful tone**

3. **Focus on benefits, not features**
   - ✅ "Everything You Need to Build Real Projects"
   - ❌ "Our Platform Features"

4. **Be scannable** (front-load important words)
